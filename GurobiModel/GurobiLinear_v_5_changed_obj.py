'''

	-Model GurobiLinear_v_3 has fewer variables since it doesnt create x_(i,k,l) if room k is closed in period l
	-Model GurobiLinear_v_4_Cliques adds Clique constraints for conflicts only one exam in a clique conflict can take place at a time
	-Model GurobiLinear_v_4_Cliques changed r in BIG-M-Method  to 12 so far

'''

'''
	***************  POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS    ***************
	
	-Add an option that such that courses in Garching are only schedule in rooms in Garchin and vice versa -> Removes lots of variables
	-Change objective function:
		-our current objective funcion fails for cliques (all exams have conflicts) for example 
			*exam1 on day 1
			*exam2 on day 5
			*exam3 on day 10
			*Our current objective function |5-1|+|10-5|+|10-1| = 18
			*exam1 on day 1
			*exam2 on day 1
			*exam3 on day 10
			*Has exactly the same objective function of 18 but clearly the first schedule is by far better
	-Change in "c6: any multi room exam takes place at one moment in time" the r in big M-Method from r to min{10, ceil(si/75)} or similiar [to discuss]
	-Idea for linking variables x and y
		*c1b creates l*i constraints this could be reduced to only i constraints
		*reason
			+"c1a" says if one exam takes place in some period than y_i,l cannot be zero 
			+ then constraint c2 forces all other y_i,l to be 0 anyway
			+ now say for all i sum(x_i,k,l for all k and for all l) >= 1 this forces at least one y_i,l to be 1 - this only has i constraints but more columns
